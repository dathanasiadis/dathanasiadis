- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dathanasiadis and I am working as a full-stack developer for GeoAnalysis S.A.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, Flask, Django, REST APIs and generally backend development (mostly).
      Docker is also in my interests as well as CI/CD.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and working on advanced Flask and Django projects.

I have a long way to becoming an expert development but I am trying to learn everyday, step by step. I really love my job and
I want to reach the highest level possible to what I'm working on.
